## Description

- The purpose of this page was to create a landing page to introduce myself, link to my work, and provide contact information and links to my social media

- This excercise is an html and css file created from scratch

- During the process of creating this page, I learned and practiced nesting html containers properly, as well as adding proper attributes and classes to reference in the CSS.
As far as the CSS goes I was able to practice and understand creating custom variables via :root and applying them to create standardized color schemes. I practiced and implimented pseudo classes to create on hover effects. Far and away the most time I spent on this project was practicing and utilizing flex box and it's properties to create a layout similar to the .gif provided. Finally I learned how to utilize media queries to resize fonts and images, place limits on image size and vertically stacked image links to line up properly on mobile and tablet.

### Tablet size:
### Nav bar has borders around links, first linked image is resized to be the same as the other 3 placeholders, and vertically stacked to fit the webpage.

## Some problems I encountered:
1. Getting flexbox to play nice and line up properly
2. Having things scale properly, grow and shrink properly
3. Getting content to not overrun its containers during media query resizing
4. Resizing images and fonts when resizing the viewport
5. Having borders not meld together during viewport resizing

# Final Thoughts:
- This was a great exercise for me to learn and apply my skills learned in the past two weeks using html and CSS. This is a basic landing page I plan on refining continuously as this
course progresses as far as sleek look and adding functionality to it. At the beginning I created a wireframe and originally designed the page to fit that layout. I didn't end up sticking to as it didn't really fit nicely with what the task required and was time consuming to switch up. As time moves on I will pare down my CSS and make it more efficient and less bloated, as well as potentially redesigning the look of the page to fit the wireframe or a new layout.
